## Key UI and UX Improvements:

**Enhanced Visual Design**

- Improved Skip Card Design: Modernized the appearance with subtle shadows, hover effects, and a clearer visual hierarchy to make each skip option more appealing and distinct.
- Modernized skip cards with better aesthetics (shadows, hover effects) and a clearer selected state using a blue border with a glow. Added a visual size comparison bar for quick understanding.

**Improved User Experience**

- Implemented a step indicator for booking progress and quick filter buttons for project types. 
- Introduced a sticky header showing the selected skip and total price on scroll.
- Included visual and textual capacity information (in black bags) for easier size understanding. 
- Improved loading and error states with dedicated components and clear feedback.
